# Corona Bingo

This project was designed to make it more fun to watch Corona related announcements in the TV. Feel free to create a new
game [on the public page](https://coronabingo.de/).

## How to play

Simply mark every word you've heard as complete by clicking it. One row horizontally, vertically or diagonal will unlock
the simple **Bingo**. Completing all fields will unlock the **BINGO BINGO**. The game does not end, giving everyone the
chance to play along.

You can invite your friends by sending them the link to the game. You'll get realtime notifications about their
progress, too.

All games and players are anonymous and will be deleted after 24h.

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
